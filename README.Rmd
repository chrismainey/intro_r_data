## Attending the course?

If you are attending the course all the course materials and preparation instructions can be viewed [here](https://philosopher-analyst.netlify.app/collection/nhsr-intro/prework/).

The GitHub source files are in a separate [GitHub repository](https://github.com/nhs-r-community/intro_r).

## Download the files

If you plan to use the RStudio Cloud you can still download the following files, but it's not necessary for the workshop. 

To download the files to use on a laptop/computer click on the green <kdb>Code</kbd> button and select `Download zip`
